# Crime Investigation System Database and Java Application

## Introduction

This project is a Crime Investigation System that includes a database and a Java application. The system is designed by Abdullah and aims to help law enforcement agencies manage and analyze crime-related data efficiently. The system consists of a database to store crime records and a Java application that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the database.

## Features

- Store crime records with details such as case number, crime type, location, date, and involved individuals.
- Add, update, and delete crime records through the Java application.
- Perform searches based on various criteria, such as case number, crime type, and date.
- Generate reports and statistics to assist in crime analysis and investigations.

## Database Design

The database is designed to store crime-related information. The main entities in the database are:

1. Crime Case: Represents individual crime cases and includes attributes like case number, crime type, location, and date.

2. Involved Individuals: Contains information about people involved in the crimes, such as suspects, victims, and witnesses. Attributes include name, age, gender, and role in the case.

## Java Application Design

The Java application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the database. It allows authorized users to perform the following actions:

- Add a new crime case and enter details about the crime and the involved individuals.
- Update existing crime records with new information or changes.
- Delete crime cases that are no longer relevant or required.
- Search for specific crime cases based on various criteria.
- Generate reports and statistics for crime analysis.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: You can clone this project repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/crime-investigation-system.git
```

Replace `your_username` with your GitHub username.

2. Set up the Database: Before running the Java application, ensure that you have set up the database and imported the necessary schema. You may use a MySQL or any other suitable database management system.

3. Import the required jar files: Make sure to include all the required jar files and dependencies for the Java application to work correctly.

4. Run the Java Application: Once the database is set up and the jar files are included, run the Java application. It should launch the GUI, and you can start interacting with the Crime Investigation System.
